# Alles Micro
This was a microblogging site, similar to Twitter, that I made in 2020. It was my biggest project back then and one of the first things I used Next.js and React for. There was a really great community of people I was friendly with on Twitter, and even though I don't speak to most of them anymore, I really enjoyed it while it lasted ðŸ¥¹

As with some of my other old projects, it's very difficult to get running because I had an unhealthy obsession with microservices, so you'd need to be running a bunch of other internal APIs.
